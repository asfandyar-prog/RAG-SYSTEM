Nuclear power plants operate under strict regulations and advanced safety systems;\\nhowever, many organizations lack modern, interactive tools to explain how safety-related decisions\\nare made in everyday operation. This communication gap can create uncertainty among local\\ncommunities, students, policymakers, and the broader public, even in regions where overall support\\nfor nuclear energy is relatively high.\\nTraditional communication methods, such as static presentations or technical reports, often fail to\\nconvey the dynamic and decision-based nature of nuclear safety. As a result, nuclear organizations\\nface a strategic challenge: while their operational safety is robust, their ability to transparently\\ncommunicate this safety in an engaging and understandable way is limited. This bottleneck can\\nreduce trust, increase hesitation, and complicate public engagement and project support,\\nparticularly among younger generations who lack direct exposure to real nuclear operations.\\nTo address this challenge, the proposed project introduces TrustBridge, an AI-powered, no-code\\nsimulator designed to make nuclear safety decision-making more transparent, understandable, and\\nrelatable. TrustBridge is conceived as a tool that nuclear organizations can use to communicate\\nsafety logic to a broad audience, including secondary school students, university students, and the\\ngeneral public. Using the platform, interactive safety scenarios can be created that reflect specific\\nreactor technologies, operational philosophies, and real-world contexts without requiring\\nprogramming skills.\\nThrough the simulator, users can explore simplified yet realistic operational scenarios, such as\\nnormal plant operation, maintenance planning, and early stress or anomaly situations. Users\\ninteract with these scenarios by making basic decisions and observing outcomes, while an\\nintegrated AI explanation system clarifies why certain actions are chosen from a safety perspective.\\nThe explanations are generated in clear, non-technical language and are grounded in fundamental\\nphysical principles, including heat transfer, reactor cooling, and the concept of layered safety\\nsystems. This approach helps demonstrate the preventive and conservative logic that defines\\nnuclear safety culture.\\nFrom a technical standpoint, TrustBridge can be implemented using no-code development tools\\nsuch as Bubble or Adalo, combined with an AI language model API for generating context-aware\\nexplanations. The interface relies on visual indicators, decision trees, and scenario-based flows\\ninstead of mathematical detail, ensuring accessibility for non-expert audiences while remaining\\nfeasible within the programme timeframe. The no-code architecture also allows the simulator to be\\nreused in classrooms, outreach events, and public engagement activities.\\nUniversity-level initiatives and innovation-focused programmes can play a key role in bridging the\\ngap between the nuclear industry, education, and society by involving students directly in the\\ndevelopment of such communication tools. Within a programme like MÜZLI, students work in\\ninterdisciplinary teams under mentor guidance to design and test real-world solutions for\\nindustry-relevant challenges. In this project, students act as intermediaries between nuclear\\norganizations and society, translating complex safety concepts into accessible digital experiences\\nwhile gaining practical innovation and entrepreneurial skills.\\nThe project is closely connected to the Hungarian nuclear context. The planned visit to the Paks\\nNuclear Power Plant will be used as an opportunity for user research and validation, focusing on\\nhow safety communication is currently handled by professionals and how digital tools could support\\ntransparency and public understanding. Insights from this interaction can inform the design of\\nscenarios inspired by VVER reactor principles used at Paks and help ensure that the simulator'),\n",

While nuclear energy enjoys relatively strong support in\\nHungary and across Europe, many people—especially younger generations—still feel uncertain\\nabout nuclear safety because they lack insight into how safety-related decisions are actually made.\\nNuclear safety is often perceived as highly complex and inaccessible, which creates psychological\\ndistance between the industry and society.\\nAlthough recent surveys indicate that a majority of Hungarians consider nuclear energy decisive in\\nthe future energy mix, hesitation persists due to misconceptions surrounding safety, risk\\nmanagement, and emergency prevention. This gap is particularly evident among students, who\\nrarely encounter nuclear topics beyond theoretical explanations and have little opportunity to\\nexplore real-world operational logic. As a result, support for nuclear energy often exists without a\\ndeeper, trust-based understanding.\\nTo address this challenge, the proposed project focuses on making nuclear safety decision-making\\ntransparent and understandable through an interactive, AI-powered educational tool. The core idea\\nis to develop a no-code Nuclear Safety Decision Simulator that allows users to explore simplified\\nbut realistic operational scenarios inspired by real nuclear power plant practices. Instead of\\npassively consuming information, users actively participate in decision-making processes and\\nobserve how different choices affect safety outcomes.\\nThe simulator presents users with scenarios such as normal operation, maintenance planning, and\\nearly warning situations. In each case, users choose between decision options and receive\\nimmediate feedback supported by an AI-based explanation system. The AI explains why certain\\ndecisions are safer, using clear language and fundamental physical principles such as heat\\ntransfer, reactor cooling, and layered safety systems. This approach highlights the preventive and\\nconservative logic that defines nuclear safety culture.\\nFrom a technical perspective, the platform can be implemented using no-code development tools\\nsuch as Bubble or Adalo, combined with an AI language model API to generate context-aware\\nexplanations. Visual indicators, decision trees, and scenario-based storytelling will be used instead\\nof mathematical complexity, ensuring accessibility for non-technical users and feasibility within the\\nprogramme timeframe.\\nThe project has strong relevance to the Hungarian nuclear context. Scenario logic can be inspired\\nby VVER reactor principles used at the Paks Nuclear Power Plant and refined based on insights\\ngained during the planned site visit and mentor consultations. The platform can also incorporate\\nshort pre- and post-use surveys to evaluate changes in user understanding and perceived trust,\\nproviding qualitative feedback on impact.\\nThis idea aligns closely with my academic background in computer science, artificial intelligence,\\nand physics-oriented thinking. By combining AI-based explanation with realistic safety logic, the\\nproject demonstrates how advanced digital tools can support transparency, education, and\\nlong-term acceptance of nuclear energy. Within the MÜZLI Scholarship Programme, the project is\\nrealistic, team-oriented, and strongly aligned with innovation and entrepreneurial objectives.\\nIn conclusion, the AI-powered Nuclear Safety Decision Simulator aims to strengthen trust in the\\nnuclear industry by transforming complex safety decision-making into an understandable,\\ninteractive experience. By showing how safety decisions are made in practice, the project supports\\ninformed societal dialogue and contributes to the responsible revitalization of the nuclear sector.'),\n",
